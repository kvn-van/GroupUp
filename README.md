# Project: GroupUp!

## Description

*GroupUp!* is an innovative social networking and event organising app designed to connect
individuals with shared interests, hobbies, or activities. Unlike traditional event-hosting
platforms that primarily focus on connecting friends or established groups, GroupUp! introduces
a unique twist by facilitating events with random participants who share a common interest.

## Purpose

GroupUp! aims to promote digital wellbeing by facilitating meaningful connections among 
individuals with shared interests, hobbies, or activities. By connecting users based on common
interests, the app encourages social interactions that can contribute to users' overall
well-being. Based on secondary research, studies have shown that meaningful social connections
can have positive effects on mental health and emotional well-being, reducing feelings of
loneliness and isolation. Therefore, the purpose of this project must be to enhance real life
interactions amongst software users to reduce social isolation. Alongside this purpose, GroupUp!
must also foster interactions between a diverse range of individuals so that the app promotes
social inclusion and diversity. Of which will all contribute to a greater level of social
well-being for the users involved. As GroupUp! encourages users to engage in offline activities
and social events a further purpose of this project is to promote a balanced approach to
technology use for all users. By facilitating real-world social interactions and offline
activities, GroupUp! helps users maintain a greater level of wellbeing by indirectly guiding a
healthy balance between online and offline experiences. Finally by leveraging the social
networking and event organising features of GroupUp!, the project is expected to provide users
with opportunities to build social support networks and connections. Studies show that social
support plays a crucial role in promoting resilience and coping with stress, therefore
contributing to overall well-being. 

## Project Scope

### Inclusions:
- GroupUp! will include features such as event creation and discovery
- The platform will only be developed for PC 
- The project scope must/extend the requirements and project considerations below using JAVA/JAVAFX:
  - A visual interface using JavaFX, providing windows for key functions.
  - An authentication system for user sign-up and sign-in, integrated with both the graphical interface and data models.
  - A system for storing, retrieving, and updating user data, integrated with both the graphical interface and data models.
  - One or more application windows where users can perform the main tasks of the application, also integrated with the graphical interface and data models.
- Project Considerations (from lecture content):
  - Choose a legible font: Sans-serif fonts preferred (e.g. Arial, Helvetica, Vedana)
  - Use a reasonable font size: Ensure it is affected by system scale. Fonts appear smaller on high-DPI devices
  - One-handed Operation: Some users won’t be able to use two hands. Your application
  - should function with only a keyboard.
  - Keyboard Shortcuts: Assign keyboard shortcuts to common actions.
  - Clear Error Messages: When there is invalid user input, clearly highlight where it is and what is wrong.
  - Avoid Error Messages: Where possible, prevent errors from occurring or suggest solutions.
  - Constrain Input: Only allow input of the correct type to be entered – e.g. no text in a phone number.
  - Highlight Errors: If there is an error in the user input, highlight exactly where it is.
  - Clearly Label Required Fields

### Exclusions:
- GroupUp! does not extend to providing professional mental health services or counselling within the app.
- The project will not focus on advanced AI algorithms for personalised recommendations beyond basic interest matching.

### Limitations/Constraints:
- Development will be constrained by available resources, including time, and technical expertise.
- The app's effectiveness in promoting digital wellbeing may be limited by external factors such as user behaviour, preferences and the actual availability of users to genuinely appear at in person/registered events.
- GroupUp! Is expected to face challenges in ensuring both digital and physical user safety and privacy, as a result robust security measures must be considered for user data and compliance with relevant regulations.
